Testing strategy (mandatory)\n\nAdditional mandatory test classes:\n- Load tests (k6) must run in CI on a schedule and on release candidates.\n- Chaos tests must run at least on release candidates (or nightly).\n- DLQ replay tests must validate idempotency and projected success computations.\n\n\n- Unit tests: pricing/policies/state machines.\n- Integration tests: dispatch, PaySurity stubs, OCR pipeline, compliance gating + notifications.\n- End-to-end (E2E) tests: rider booking, driver acceptance, trip completion, payouts, messaging, ratings.\n- Platform console can trigger tests and display results.\n\n---\n\n## 17. Acceptance test catalog (minimum)\n\nAdditional release gate acceptance tests (minimum):\n- GO / NO-GO gates evaluate from `out/k6.json`, `out/chaos.json`, `out/dlq.json` and produce `out/go-no-go.md`.\n- k6 failure rate < 0.5% and k6 p95 < 300 ms.\n- Chaos recovery ≤ 5 seconds.\n- DLQ projected replay success ≥ 70%.\n- Zero double assignments and zero invalid queue states under dispatch storm.\n\n- Compliance expiry gating blocks go-online/accepting; D-14 and D-1 notifications delivered and logged.\n- OCR auto-fills doc fields; driver confirms; tenant approves.\n- After assignment, rider sees driver live location and ETA refresh every 60 seconds.\n- Arrival detection starts wait timer; fees apply per configuration.\n- Scheduled ride requires driver confirmation; missing confirmation triggers re-offer and dispatch alert.\n- Luggage fee and fit warning + upgrade suggestion operate correctly.\n- Split-pay settles correctly and refunds allocate proportionally.\n- Surge disable forces multiplier=1.0; regional cap clamps multiplier.\n- Destination mode region disable suppresses bias; per-driver override can re-enable.\n- Preferred tiering prioritizes Professional Chauffeur + Large Luxury SUV over others (within ETA bounds).\n- Kill switches deactivate tenant/driver/vehicle within 60 seconds with audit.\n- Mutual-block pairing prevents a blocked driver/rider match.\n\n---\n\n## 18. Non-functional requirements\n- Availability 99.9%.\n- Accessibility: Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 AA.\n- Privacy: masked contact info; flight details never shown to drivers.\n- Security: audit trails for policy and administrative actions.\n\n- Backups and disaster recovery:\n  - Automated PostgreSQL backups with point-in-time recovery (PITR) (Point-In-Time Recovery).\n  - Recovery Point Objective (RPO): ≤ 15 minutes. Recovery Time Objective (RTO): ≤ 4 hours (configurable; stricter targets allowed for premium tiers).\n  - Quarterly restore drills and documented runbooks; failures trigger alerts.\n\n---\n\n## 19. Flight awareness (privacy)\n- Track flight ETA and adjust pickup; never expose flight details to drivers.\n- Provider calls cached and rate-limited; PII redacted in driver payloads.\n\n---\n\n## 20. Hard anti-drift rule\nIf a missing timer/state transition/policy precedence is discovered during build, it must be added to this document before implementation proceeds.\n\n## 21. Marketplace, ads, and paid placements (feature-gated)\n- Tenant microsites and/or platform site may include a Marketplace section for:\n  - Emergency recovery offers,\n  - Marketing services,\n  - Paid placements.\n- Paid placements require:\n  - Admin approval workflow,\n  - Start/end dates,\n  - Disclosure labels,\n  - Reporting (impressions, clicks, conversions).\n\n\n## 22. Chicagoland events engine (demand forecasting) (feature-gated)\n- The platform must support automated ingestion of events (weekly minimum cadence):\n  - Concerts,\n  - Sports,\n  - Cultural events.\n- Ingestion sources may include web scraping and partner feeds (must be policy-controlled, rate-limited, and legally compliant).\n- Normalized event fields (minimum):\n  - name, venue, geo, start/end date-time, category/type, expected attendance (optional), source URL.\n- Events drive demand forecasting for pricing and driver positioning (never overrides fairness or safety policies).\n\n\n## 23. Provenance appendix (non-authoritative)\nThis section is **non-authoritative** and exists only to show source traceability for the semantic merge.\n\n- Source A (target authority): `BlackRavenia_RideShare_Canonical_Requirements_v6_1.md`\n- Source B (merged): `RideShare-chat1-requirements.txt`\n- Source C (merged context): `rideshare context.txt`\n\nAll requirements in Sources B and C have been incorporated into the authoritative sections above. If an omission is discovered, the omission must be added above (not here) per §20 Hard anti-drift rule."
