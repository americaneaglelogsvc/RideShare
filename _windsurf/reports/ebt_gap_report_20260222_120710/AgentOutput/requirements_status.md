## Notes (only items with evidence/gaps/notes)
### BRRS-1.1 — Canonical build rules (strict)
**Evidence:**
- file:/home/runner/work/UrwayDispatch/UrwayDispatch/Requirements/BlackRavenia_UrwayDispatch_Canonical_Requirements_v6_1_MERGED_REORG_v3.md
**Gaps:**
- No explicit evidence in AS-IS/SNIPPETS of running as_is_scan.md, populating requirements_status.md, or updating implemented_not_documented.md as mandated.
**Notes:**
AS-IS confirms the canonical requirements file exists, but provides no concrete, typed evidence of the mandated process artifacts being produced/maintained.

### BRRS-1.2 — Definition of Done (DoD) (strict by default)
**Gaps:**
- No evidence of screen_index.md presence/contents or any designed state machines/timers (Designed).
- No evidence of end-to-end UI→API→DB→side-effects paths for capabilities (Implemented).
- No evidence of automated tests or CI proof for passing tests (Tested).
**Notes:**
AS-IS only lists a few UI page file paths and table names without columns/routes/tests/CI workflows, which is insufficient to meet DoD evidence gates.

### BRRS-1.3 — Required build artifacts (must be produced by agentic AI)
**Gaps:**
- No evidence that as_is_scan.md exists as a maintained artifact (only referenced in the prompt summary, not evidenced by file:path).
- No evidence that requirements_status.md exists/maintained with evidence links.
- No evidence that progress_report.md exists.
- No evidence that implemented_not_documented.md exists.
- No evidence of required endpoint/DB migration/query evidence needed to mark items Implemented/Tested under the evidence gates.
**Notes:**
The prompt includes an 'As-Is Scan (summary)' but does not provide file:path evidence that the required artifacts are present in the repo.

### BRRS-1.4 — Production readiness gates (GO / NO-GO) (hard gates)
**Gaps:**
- No evidence of a deterministic gate evaluator script (e.g., file:scripts/go-no-go-gates.js).
- No evidence of CI workflow running GO/NO-GO evaluation.
- No evidence of artifacts out/k6.json, out/chaos.json, out/dlq.json, or generated out/go-no-go.md.
- No evidence enforcing the listed hard gates (k6 thresholds, double-assignment detection, invalid queue transitions, chaos recovery, DLQ replay projection).
**Notes:**
AS-IS provides no ci:workflow or file:path evidence for gate evaluation automation.

### BRRS-1.5 — Safe deployment automation (canary + rollback) (mandatory)
**Gaps:**
- No evidence of deployment automation supporting canary 25%→50%→100%.
- No evidence of automatic rollback on gate failure.
- No evidence of Git tagging, config snapshotting (feature flags/policy versions), or storing GO/NO-GO report artifact in CI.
**Notes:**
No ci:workflow or deployment-related file:path evidence provided in AS-IS/SNIPPETS.
