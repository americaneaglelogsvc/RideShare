## Notes (only items with evidence/gaps/notes)
### BRRS-1.1 — Canonical build rules (strict)
**Evidence:**
- file:/home/runner/work/UrwayDispatch/UrwayDispatch/Requirements/BlackRavenia_UrwayDispatch_Canonical_Requirements_v6_1_MERGED_REORG_v3.md
**Gaps:**
- No evidence in AS-IS/SNIPPETS that an `as_is_scan.md` run is enforced/recorded before changes.
- No evidence that `requirements_status.md` is populated/maintained with evidence links.
- No evidence that this requirements document is being updated with implemented-but-not-documented items per the described process.
**Notes:**
AS-IS only confirms the canonical requirements file exists; no enforceable build-rule workflow artifacts were provided in AS-IS/SNIPPETS.

### BRRS-1.2 — Definition of Done (DoD) (strict by default)
**Evidence:**
- file:/home/runner/work/UrwayDispatch/UrwayDispatch/Requirements/BlackRavenia_UrwayDispatch_Canonical_Requirements_v6_1_MERGED_REORG_v3.md
- ui:apps/driver-app/src/pages/AirportQueuePage.tsx
- ui:apps/driver-app/src/pages/AuthPage.tsx
- ui:apps/driver-app/src/pages/DashboardPage.tsx
- ui:apps/driver-app/src/pages/EarningsPage.tsx
- ui:apps/driver-app/src/pages/OnboardingPage.tsx
- ui:apps/driver-app/src/pages/ProfilePage.tsx
- ui:apps/driver-app/src/pages/TripPage.tsx
- ui:apps/rider-app/src/pages/BookingPage.tsx
**Gaps:**
- No route: evidence provided (API endpoints list is empty in AS-IS sample).
- No db:table.column evidence available (DB scan lists tables but columns are unknown and no file:line mappings were provided).
- No test: evidence provided (Tests sample empty).
- No ci:workflow evidence provided.
**Notes:**
UI pages are present, but DoD requires end-to-end UI→API→DB and tests/CI proof; AS-IS lacks those evidence primitives.

### BRRS-1.3 — Required build artifacts (must be produced by agentic AI)
**Evidence:**
- file:/home/runner/work/UrwayDispatch/UrwayDispatch/Requirements/BlackRavenia_UrwayDispatch_Canonical_Requirements_v6_1_MERGED_REORG_v3.md
**Gaps:**
- No evidence that `as_is_scan.md` exists (only an AS-IS summary was provided in prompt, not a repository file path).
- No evidence that `requirements_status.md`, `progress_report.md`, or `implemented_not_documented.md` exist as files in the repo (no file:path evidence in AS-IS/SNIPPETS).
- No route:/db:/test:/ci: evidence available to satisfy the described evidence gates.
**Notes:**
Cannot mark implemented without concrete repository artifacts; prompt-provided AS-IS summary is not itself file:path evidence of required build artifacts.

### BRRS-1.4 — Production readiness gates (GO / NO-GO) (hard gates)
**Evidence:**
- file:/home/runner/work/UrwayDispatch/UrwayDispatch/Requirements/BlackRavenia_UrwayDispatch_Canonical_Requirements_v6_1_MERGED_REORG_v3.md
**Gaps:**
- No evidence of a gate evaluator script (e.g., `scripts/go-no-go-gates.js`) via file:path.
- No ci:workflow evidence showing a GO/NO-GO job that reads `out/k6.json`, `out/chaos.json`, `out/dlq.json` and emits `out/go-no-go.md`.
- No evidence of k6/chaos/DLQ artifacts or any enforcement to block deployments.
**Notes:**
AS-IS/SNIPPETS contain no CI/workflow/script artifacts for deterministic release gating.

### BRRS-1.5 — Safe deployment automation (canary + rollback) (mandatory)
**Evidence:**
- file:/home/runner/work/UrwayDispatch/UrwayDispatch/Requirements/BlackRavenia_UrwayDispatch_Canonical_Requirements_v6_1_MERGED_REORG_v3.md
**Gaps:**
- No ci:workflow evidence for canary rollout stages (25%→50%→100%).
- No evidence of automatic rollback on gate failure.
- No evidence of release tagging, runtime config snapshotting, or storing GO/NO-GO report artifact in CI.
**Notes:**
No deployment automation evidence was provided in AS-IS/SNIPPETS.
