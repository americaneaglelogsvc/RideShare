## Notes (only items with evidence/gaps/notes)
### BRRS-1.1 — Canonical build rules (strict)
**Evidence:**
- file:/home/runner/work/UrwayDispatch/UrwayDispatch/Requirements/BlackRavenia_UrwayDispatch_Canonical_Requirements_v6_1_MERGED_REORG_v3.md
**Gaps:**
- No evidence in AS-IS/SNIPPETS of an executed `as_is_scan.md` run, or of populated `requirements_status.md`, or updates to `implemented_not_documented.md` performed by an agentic AI.
- No concrete routes/db/tests/ci evidence provided in AS-IS/SNIPPETS to satisfy the strict evidence linkage rule described in the requirement.
**Notes:**
Only a canonical requirements document path is evidenced in AS-IS. No supporting artifact files or evidence links were provided in the batch.

### BRRS-1.2 — Definition of Done (DoD) (strict by default)
**Gaps:**
- No evidence in AS-IS/SNIPPETS of end-to-end paths (UI→API→DB→side effects) being mapped per capability.
- No evidence of automated tests or CI workflows satisfying the DoD levels (Designed/Implemented/Tested/Shippable/Launch-ready).
**Notes:**
AS-IS lists some UI pages, but provides no route/db/test/ci evidence to validate DoD for any capability.

### BRRS-1.3 — Required build artifacts (must be produced by agentic AI)
**Evidence:**
- file:/home/runner/work/UrwayDispatch/UrwayDispatch/Requirements/BlackRavenia_UrwayDispatch_Canonical_Requirements_v6_1_MERGED_REORG_v3.md
**Gaps:**
- No evidence that required artifacts exist: `as_is_scan.md`, `requirements_status.md`, `progress_report.md`, `implemented_not_documented.md` (no file:path evidence provided).
- No evidence gates satisfied (no route/db/test/ci artifacts cited in AS-IS/SNIPPETS).
**Notes:**
Cannot mark implemented without explicit file/path evidence of the required artifacts.

### BRRS-1.4 — Production readiness gates (GO / NO-GO) (hard gates)
**Gaps:**
- No evidence of a deterministic gate evaluator script (e.g., `scripts/go-no-go-gates.js`) (no file:path).
- No evidence of CI producing/reading `out/k6.json`, `out/chaos.json`, `out/dlq.json`, or emitting `out/go-no-go.md` (no ci:workflow / file:path).
- No evidence of hard-gate assertions (double assignment, invalid queue state transitions, recovery time, DLQ replay projection) being evaluated.
**Notes:**
No CI/workflow or scripts evidence provided in AS-IS/SNIPPETS.

### BRRS-1.5 — Safe deployment automation (canary + rollback) (mandatory)
**Gaps:**
- No evidence of canary rollout automation 25%→50%→100% (no ci:workflow or deployment config files).
- No evidence of automatic rollback tied to GO/NO-GO gates (no ci:workflow).
- No evidence of release tagging, runtime config snapshotting, or storing GO/NO-GO report as CI artifact (no ci:workflow).
**Notes:**
No deployment automation evidence provided in AS-IS/SNIPPETS.
