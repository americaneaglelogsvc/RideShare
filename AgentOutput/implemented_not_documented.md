# Implemented but Not Documented

## Database schema changes (unspecified) via Supabase migrations

**Evidence:**
- supabase/migrations/20250902065233_jade_sea.sql
- supabase/migrations/20250902144451_solitary_voice.sql
- supabase/migrations/20250902150446_violet_waterfall.sql

**Why not in requirements:**
The candidates indicate concrete implementation work (SQL migrations), but the requirements batch provided is primarily process/DoD/personas/tenancy. Without the migration contents, we cannot map these schema changes to any specific requirement in the batch, so they are treated as implemented-but-not-documented relative to this batch.
